# godot-game-boilerplate

This is a simple Godot engine project including dummy menus (main men√∫, credits and how to play) and a dummy main scene.

This project also includes a simple `export.sh` script (Linux only) for exporting project to multiple platforms (Windows, Linux and HTML).

## Exporting (Linux only)

Run the export script. Packages will be generated in `export/` and `export/zip` directories.

        bash export.sh <game-name> <version>

For example:

        bash export.sh awesome-game v1.0
